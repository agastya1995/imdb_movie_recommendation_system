# An Item-Based Collaborative Filtering Approach #

**The model has been hosted on an Amazon AWS EC2 instance, [here](http://ec2-35-174-113-76.compute-1.amazonaws.com/)**

**Since the instance has been created using and AWS educate account, the instance will automatically shut down a year from now (on 6 November, 2012)**
**Additionally, the instance may shut down sooner if it crosses the free tier limits.** 

This file has the source code of the hosted model. To run it, you will need to follow these steps:
1. Download the 'ml-latest.zip' file (size 265 mb) from the movie lens website [here](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).
2. Extract the file to the folder which has the main.ipynb file.
3. Run the ipynb file.

You could also only run the model, based on the pickled files.
